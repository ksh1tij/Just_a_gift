    I have come to realize<br>
    I'm an addict<br>
    I crave your attention<br>
    When you're near<br>
    I wait for others to leave

  <div class="underneath">
    So I can pull out my phone And get my fix<br>
    A simple reply is enough for me<br>
    To smile and sink into my chair<br>
    You're my personal supply of dopamine<br>
    I'm addicted to how you make me feel Seems I can never get enough

<div>
  <div class="underneath">
    Even when I have you here<br>
    But does that mean it's not real?<br>
    Once you're gone, I go through withdrawals<br>
    I get frantic that you're not close<br>
    I panic as the hours go by

  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <div class="underneath">
    And I'm left without your voice<br>
    To soothe my soul<br>
    So I sit and wait as my world seems<br>
    To slowly break<br>
    Until you message me<br>
    And dopamine hits my veins Once again
